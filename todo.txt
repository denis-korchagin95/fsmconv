language:
	(?) define user's special-characters to alias character list or character
	(?) change the keyword 'empty' to 'epsilon' and refactor code to match it
parser:
	(?) reuse characters to low memory usage
	(?) reuse character list to low memory usage
	(?) reuse transition to low memory usage
	(?) continue parsing to find out more errors after getting the first error
	(?) after parsing check out parse tree on correctness
	(?) show errors in context of the source
	(?) implement hash table for any strings to low memory usage
debug:
	(?) fix parse tree printing ('debug_symbol' function)
refactor:
	(?) rename 'nfa_' term to 'fsm_' term in the code
